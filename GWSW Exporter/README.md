# GWSW Exporter

This is an export tool that converts data to the GWSW-OroX Turtle (TTL) format, in accordance with the specifications of Stichting RIONED.

This is a work in progress that has only just begun. The first commit is an empty framework set up with the "MVP-Setup" tool. The read, mapping, and export functionality has yet to be built. The MVP-Setup tool used was created by Benny Christensen. The tool and the source can be found at: https://gitlab.com/cdbc-public/releases/mvp-setup
