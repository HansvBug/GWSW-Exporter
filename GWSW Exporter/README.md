# GWSW Exporter

This is an export tool that converts data to the GWSW-OroX Turtle (TTL) format, in accordance with the specifications of Stichting RIONED.

This is a work in progress that has only just begun. You can view the progress in the change log. 
The MVP framework is created with the help of "The MVP-Setup" tool, created by Benny Christensen. The tool and the source can be found at: https://gitlab.com/cdbc-public/releases/mvp-setup

Place gwsw_exporter.exe in its own directory and put the .en and .nl files in the same directory. Only then start the application.
Before you can retrieve data, a Query must be loaded. (Query tab). And before you can export, a mapping file must be present. (Settings tab).

For the time being, the application is only suitable for Windows.
