# GWSW Exporter

This is an export tool that converts data to the GWSW-OroX Turtle (TTL) format, in accordance with the specifications of Stichting RIONED.

This is a work in progress that has only just begun. You can view the progress in the change log. 
The MVP-Setup tool used was created by Benny Christensen. The tool and the source can be found at: https://gitlab.com/cdbc-public/releases/mvp-setup

Place gwsw_exporter.exe in its own directory and put the .en and .nl files in the same directory. Only then start the application.
For the time being, the application is only suitable for Windows.
